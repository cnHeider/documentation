Motion
======

Motions are abstractions of spendature of energy and where the energy should be spent. These is simply an address on an actor_ and a motor_ with an assigned energy strength, this energy may be positive or negative to indicate for example expansion and contraction of a motor_ or the torque applied to a motor_ clock-wise or anti-clock-wise. Its is the absolute magnitude of the strenght that counts towards total energy spendature.
Motions are passed through reaction_ model as messages produced by the agent, this the way the external agent affect the environment.
