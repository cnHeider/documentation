Neodroid is relevant to the following aspects that FRINATEK scheme promotes:
Scientific quality at the forefront of international research
Deep learning applied to robot visual-motor tasks is a very nascent research field, with 2015 being
the first year in which this has been explored in the simplest of grasping tasks, by Cornell
University [1] and later in 2016 at Google [2]. Independently, and at around the same time, we
began our early work [15] on this topic – to be published later this year (2016). Hence in this
regard, we are in the international forefront already. Beyond this, we have a deep learning paradigm
that differs both from that of Cornell and Google. Our approach has greater potential and crosssynergies
with the developments within virtual reality (VR), coinciding with the introduction of the
first consumer-quality VR technology in 2016. The combination of deep learning and virtual reality
is a key novelty of our project and we are the first to apply this to developing robot brains with
visual-motor ability.

Boldness in scientific thinking and innovation

The potential for Neodroid is to open doors to a whole new area of research with wide impact for
the future. When virtual reality becomes commonplace and of a high quality in a few years, it will
enable humans to teach virtual workers and robots what to do – all in virtual reality – and the brains
of these virtual workers or robots can be transferred to physical robots anywhere – on- or off-planet.
This can revolutionize the way humans teach robots and the way robots assist humans. As a
stepping stone, this has the potential to enable greater endeavours for the human race, such as
remote construction of factories and resource mining in space, affordable and automated
construction of homes on Earth, as well as automated farming and processing of food, personal
assistants to humans and manufacturing of robots themselves. Taken further, the potential is the
duplication of the visual-motor skills of a human expert anywhere on Earth into many robots
anywhere in the Solar System – hence solving the challenge of expensive human labour costs and
worker availability currently inhibiting the progress of human evolution. This is the bold potential,

and we believe in this light that the Neodroid project is a worthy and realistic first step towards this
exciting potential.

Careers for young research talents

Through is early career as research scientist, Dr. John Reidar Mathiassen has had practical
implementation and management experience in introducing machine vision and robotics to use in
the Norwegian fisheries and aquaculture industries. He is also a visionary and sees the immense
potential for future scientific innovation in robotics applications. The combination of practical
experience and being a visionary has led him to look for and discover some critical next steps in
deep learning, virtual reality and humanoid robotics – steps requiring focus now in order to lay the
foundation for the future. Neodroid is a stepping stone for Dr. Mathiassen, and will enable him to
develop his career so that he can start building up a research group to develop an exciting new (yet
to be named) research field spanning deep learning, virtual reality and robotics.
